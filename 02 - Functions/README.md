# Functions

A function is just a block of code that you can call anytime you want from another block of code.  You should make a code into a function if you are going to re-use that block of code in several places.

### Example
Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to x.  Then write a program below it that calls this function 3 times.  Your output should be:
```
Counting to 5...
1
2
3
4
5
Counting to 3...
1
2
3
Counting to 6...
1
2
3
4
5
6
```

Example is in this folder called `counter.js`

Write this program 5x while "cheating" (looking at the answer) and 5x without looking at the answer.
