# Getting Started

## Node.js

Node.js is really just a program on your machine that runs (or "executes") programs that you can write and feed into it.  The way to get node to run a program you've written is to just type `node <program-name>`.


To get started, we're just going to get practice setting up a node program and running it.

1. Create a new folder inside of your coding folder called "helloWorld" and cd into it:

	```
	mkdir helloWorld
	cd helloWorld
	```
2. Make a new file called `helloWorld.js` and open the folder with your sublime text editor:

	```
	touch helloWorld.js
	subl .
	```

3. Type some code into `HelloWorld.js` (via sublime text) and save it.

  	```
  	console.log('Hello World!');
  	```
  	
4. Now from the terminal, make sure you're in the same folder as your `helloWorld.js` file and execute it with node:

	```
	node helloWorld.js
	```
	
5. You should get "Hello World!" in your terminal output.

## Practice

Delete the entire folder and redo the exercise 10x.
