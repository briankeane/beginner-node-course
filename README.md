# Beginner Node Course

## How to take this
For each section, create a new git repository and commit all your changes.

```
cd code
mkdir nameOfNewSection  # (helloWorld)
cd nameOfNewSection
```

Then go to https://www.github.com, sign in, and click on the green "New Repository" button in the left side panel.

Choose a name for your repo (usually the same as the folder name, but you can put whatever you want)

Follow the instructions on the next screen to create and push up your code.


Every time you make a significant change to your code, push up your changes like this:

```
git add --all  # Best to add files one-by-one, but --all will work for now
git commit -m "A message about what you did (ex: 'fix syntax error')"
git push origin master
```
